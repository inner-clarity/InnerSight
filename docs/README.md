# InnerSight
## Professional Perspectives on Emotional Regulation and Religious Practice

---

### Purpose

InnerSight is a research initiative dedicated to examining the intersection between mental health, uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures, and religious practice within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

### Professional Foundation

This work arises from the identified need for greater understanding and institutional support for members who use unconventional methods of emotional regulation as part of their healing process and mental well-being. The research is based on established principles of clinical psychology, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and revealed doctrine.
