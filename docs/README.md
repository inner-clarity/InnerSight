# InnerSight  
## Informed Support for the Inclusion of All God's Children  

An educational resource to better understand mental health and neurological needs in the context of the Gospel

---

### Purpose

InnerSight is an educational resource that seeks to support leaders, families, and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in better understanding how neurological differences and trauma responses may require legitimate forms of emotional regulation. This work is based on clinical evidence, Gospel principles, and the shared desire to minister with Christ-like love.

### Foundation

This resource responds to common questions from leaders and families about how to support faithful members whose mental health or neurological needs require specific adaptations. It is based on recognized clinical standards (such as the DSM-5), neuroscience research, and principles of the restored Gospel.

## Main Content

### [Psychological Foundations](/InnerSight/en/analisis_psicologico_apropiado_v2)
This section presents a clinical perspective on how people regulate their emotions, especially when they have experienced trauma or have neurological differences. It explains when certain responses are necessary adaptive strategies—not disorders—according to current medical criteria, including neuroscience and international diagnostic guidelines.

### [Clinical Understanding of Emotional Regulation Needs](/InnerSight/en/scientific_foundation_validation)
Evidence-based guide to recognize when certain behaviors reflect neurological needs or trauma responses, rather than personal preferences. Includes clinical criteria, illustrative examples, and guidance for leaders and families who wish to minister with understanding.

### [Impact of Demanding Abandonment of Necessary Regulatory Strategies](/InnerSight/en/effects_of_coercive_restrictions)
This section explains, based on neuroscience and clinical studies, how asking someone to stop using an essential emotional regulation strategy—even with good intentions—can cause additional distress, functional deterioration, and spiritual distancing.

### [When Love is Conditioned on Conformity](/InnerSight/en/emotional_blackmail)
Some members report feeling that their belonging or spiritual worth depends on abandoning certain emotional regulation needs. This section analyzes how these dynamics—though unintended—can affect faith, self-esteem, and relationships, and offers principles for ministering without imposing conditions.

### [Nature of Emotional Regulation](/InnerSight/en/Nature_of_Emotional_Regulation)
Some people confuse certain emotional regulation strategies with matters of identity or sexual preference. This section offers a clear clinical explanation, based on neuroscience, about why these needs are related to mental and neurological health, not sexual orientation.

### [Emotional Marital Security](/InnerSight/en/Emotional_Marital_Security)
This section examines how coercive restrictions in marital intimacy can affect emotional security and mental health of spouses. It analyzes the impact on marital relationships when restrictions are imposed that interfere with legitimate emotional regulation, offering perspectives based on Gospel principles and clinical understanding of marital intimacy.

### [Spiritual Dignity and Mental Health](/InnerSight/en/sacerdocio_salud_mental_apropiado_v5)  
This section examines how Gospel teachings—including the Scriptures, The Family Proclamation, and modern revelation—affirm that a member's dignity before God does not depend on their mental health or neurological condition, but on their faith, repentance, and desire to follow Christ.

### [Institutional Proposal](/InnerSight/en/proposal_v1_en)
Comprehensive proposal submitted to The First Presidency for institutional inclusion in mental health and neurological conditions. Includes scientific foundation, doctrinal harmony, and proposed institutional statement with clear guidance for leaders and communities.

### [Frequently Asked Questions for Leaders](/InnerSight/en/PreguntasFrecuentes)
Common questions and answers for leaders seeking to better understand how to support members with mental health and neurological needs. Includes practical guidance on distinguishing legitimate needs, temple worthiness, family dynamics, and reasonable accommodations.

### [Guide for Difficult Family Conversations](/InnerSight/en/Guia_conversacion)
Practical guide for members and families facing challenging conversations about mental health or neurological needs. Includes specific guidance for both those with the needs and family members, with communication strategies, emotional management, and professional support seeking.
