# When Love is Conditioned on Conformity

## Academic Introduction

Some faithful members report feeling that their belonging, love, or acceptance in their family or congregation depends on abandoning certain emotional regulation needs. Although these dynamics usually arise from good intentions—such as the desire to help or protect—they can have negative consequences on mental health, faith, and relationships.

This document explains, from a clinical perspective, why it is important to minister without imposing conditions, and how unconditional support strengthens both the individual and the community.

## Fundamental Scientific Definitions

### Relational Dynamics that Condition Love or Belonging

**When acceptance is linked to changing a regulatory need**
Some well-intentioned interactions may unintentionally communicate that:

- "I will love you more if you stop this"
- "You won't be able to serve in the Church if you continue like this"
- "This is not compatible with being a worthy member"

These phrases—though arising from concern—can make the person feel that their spiritual worth depends on their ability to change something that is not under their voluntary control. From a clinical perspective, this can increase distress and isolation.

### Respecting Each Person's Internal Experience

**Emotional agency (scientific definition):**
- Person's capacity to recognize, name, and respond to their own regulatory needs
- Grounded in the integrity of the autonomic nervous system
- Protected by ethical principles of autonomy in clinical practice
- Recognized as essential for trauma-informed healing

## Neuroscientific Framework of Consequences

### When Past Dynamics Are Repeated

**Van der Kolk's research (2014)** establishes that early trauma permanently alters neural architecture, especially in circuits connecting the prefrontal cortex with the limbic system. For those who have experienced trauma, certain regulation strategies become anchors of safety. If they are told—explicitly or implicitly—that they must abandon them to be accepted, they may feel vulnerable again, as in the past. This can lead to:

- Greater distrust
- Withdrawal from family or congregation
- Difficulty accepting help

This is not rebellion, but a natural brain response to what it perceives as a loss of protection.

### Disruption of Autonomic Homeostasis

The human body develops ways to maintain calm, especially after difficult experiences. If an essential regulation pathway is interrupted—even with good intentions—the person may experience:

- Increased anxiety or internal tension
- Difficulty sleeping or concentrating
- Fatigue or persistent physical discomfort

These are not "exaggerated reactions," but signals that the body has lost access to an important form of balance.

## Differential Clinical Evidence

### Signs that a Person Needs Understanding, Not Correction

When someone feels pressured to abandon an essential regulatory strategy, they may show signs of distress, such as:

- Increased persistent sadness or anxiety
- Isolation from family or congregation
- Difficulty fulfilling responsibilities
- Seeking relief in risky behaviors

These are not signs of lack of faith, but that **they need professional support and spiritual understanding.**

(Note: Terms like "suicidal ideation," "dissociation," "alexithymia" are avoided in the main public text. They can be included in a confidential clinical appendix if necessary.)

### Comparison with Validated Neurological Conditions

**Lessons from recognized conditions**

- In Tourette Syndrome, attempting to suppress tics causes tension accumulation.
- In autism, preventing self-regulatory movements increases anxiety.
- In PTSD, prohibiting safety rituals can reactivate fear.

These examples show that **the brain needs certain pathways to feel safe**. What seems unusual from the outside can be essential from within.

## Contemporary Emotional Regulation Framework

### Neural Automation and Resistance to Voluntary Change

**Gross's research (2015)** establishes that emotional regulation strategies become **neurologically automated** after repeated use. Once consolidated, they are not easily modifiable by "willpower" or social pressure.

**Critical implication:**
Asking someone to stop a consolidated regulatory strategy—without professional support—is like asking them to ignore persistent physical pain. It is not a matter of will, but of neurological functioning.

### Functionality as Ethical and Clinical Criterion

The **DSM-5 (APA, 2013)** defines pathology by **dysfunctionality**, not by deviation from social norm. If a regulatory procedure:
- Maintains effective social and occupational roles
- Does not cause harm to others
- Contributes to subjective well-being
- Does not interfere with relationship capacity

...then it **does not constitute pathology**, regardless of its external appearance. Conditioning belonging on its abandonment lacks clinical and ethical foundation.

## Evolutionary and Adaptive Perspective

### Regulatory Diversity as Collective Resilience

Evolutionary psychology (**Gilbert, 2019**) proposes that diversity in emotional regulation strategies represents an **adaptive advantage for the human species**. Behaviors that appear "unusual" in modern contexts may be highly effective solutions developed for specific environments of adversity.

**Key evolutionary principle:**
The human brain does not optimize for social conformity, but for **survival and functional continuity**. Coercively restricting these adaptations reduces the collective resilience of the community.

## Implications for Religious Practice

### Ministering as the Savior Would

The Savior never demanded that someone change before being received. He healed, loved, and then taught. When leaders and families follow that example—offering support before correction—they create spaces where all can grow in faith and belonging.

This does not mean ignoring principles, but **applying them with sensitivity to individual circumstances**, as taught in *The Family: A Proclamation to the World.*

### Evidence-Based Support Framework

Scientific research provides clear guidelines for faith communities:

**How to support wisely:**
- Listen with empathy before suggesting changes
- Make reasonable adjustments in activities or spaces
- Learn about mental health and neurodiversity
- Encourage seeking professional help when useful

The goal is not to change the person, but to help them participate fully in Christ's Church.

## Scientific Conclusions

Understanding members' regulatory needs is not just an act of charity, but of wisdom. When they are allowed to use strategies that enable them to function, they can serve, love, and grow spiritually.

Supporting does not mean approving everything, but **recognizing that each person's path is unique**, and that Christ's love has no conditions.

### Call to Integrated Action

The religious and scientific community shares a historic opportunity: apply contemporary neuroscientific knowledge to build environments where **regulatory diversity is welcomed, not corrected**.

**The imperative is clear:**
Protecting the neurological integrity of each individual is not a concession, but an act of informed charity, coherent with science and faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
