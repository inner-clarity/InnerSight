The Savior Himself taught us: &quot;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest&quot; (Matthew 11:28). This fundamental principle must guide our understanding and support for those members of our community who face unique mental health and neurological challenges, including conditions such as Tourette Syndrome, autism, ADHD, and other neurological differences.</p> <h3 id="principles-of-inclusion-and-understanding"><a href="#principles-of-inclusion-and-understanding" class="header-anchor">#</a> Principles of Inclusion and Understanding</h3> <p><strong>Harmony with The Family: A Proclamation to the World</strong></p> <p>These principles are in perfect harmony with The Family: A Proclamation to the World, which recognizes that &quot;disability, death, or other circumstances (such as those requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures) may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended family members should provide support when needed.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Full Access to Priesthood and Ordinances</strong></p> <p>We reaffirm that mental health and neurological conditions, including those requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures or conditions such as Tourette Syndrome, do not deprive any worthy member of access to the priesthood or sacred ordinances and the service in the Church. This includes situations where a person's emotional or neurological wellbeing requires:</p> <ul><li>Specific clothing items</li> <li>Medical or therapeutic devices</li> <li>Bandages or support products</li> <li>Diapers or other personal care accessories</li> <li>Any other elements necessary for emotional or neurological regulation</li> <li>Involuntary movements or necessary regulatory behaviors (such as tics in Tourette Syndrome)</li></ul> <p>These items and behaviors, when part of an inherent neurological condition or a healing process supervised or not by mental health professionals (that may or may not last a lifetime), must be respected and permitted in all Church buildings (if they comply with Church standards) and home activities.</p> <h3 id="call-to-empathy-and-understanding"><a href="#call-to-empathy-and-understanding" class="header-anchor">#</a> Call to Empathy and Understanding</h3> <p><strong>Neurological need and not a whim</strong></p> <p>It is essential to understand that many of the behaviors or needs associated with uncommon emotional regulation are not voluntary choices, whimsical preferences, or acts of rebellion, but deeply rooted neurological responses that arise from the structure and functioning of the nervous system. Contemporary science has demonstrated that these regulatory strategies—such as tics in Tourette Syndrome, &quot;stimming&quot; in autism, or certain self-regulation rituals following traumatic experiences—are legitimate adaptive mechanisms, consolidated through neurological development or as a response to adverse circumstances. Attempting to suppress them without understanding can generate real physiological distress, intense anxiety, or even functional collapse. Therefore, they should not be seen as behaviors that &quot;should be overcome&quot; with willpower, but as valid needs that deserve respect, accommodation, and support. By recognizing their neurological foundation, we honor both science and doctrine, and fulfill the mandate to minister with knowledge and true love.</p> <p><strong>Do Not Judge</strong></p> <p>We urge all members, leaders, and families to refrain from making judgments about mental health and neurological situations that may seem uncommon or difficult to understand, including conditions such as Tourette Syndrome, involuntary movements, or specific regulatory needs. Let us remember that &quot;man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart&quot; (1 Samuel 16:7).</p> <p><strong>Do Not Exclude</strong></p> <p>No behavior related to mental health conditions or neurological differences should be grounds for exclusion from our congregations, activities, or worship services, even in family settings. Diversity in forms of healing, recovery, and neurological regulation <strong>should be seen as a manifestation of our Heavenly Father's infinite compassion</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Do Not Misinterpret</strong></p> <p>We recognize that we often do not know the background, trauma, neurological conditions, or circumstances that have led a person to need uncommon specific forms of emotional or neurological regulation. It should not be seen as &quot;Teaching this is wrong and is trauma for children and the rising generation.&quot; Instead of making assumptions, <strong>we should approach with humility and genuine desire to understand.</strong> Let us remember that our calling is to love and serve, not to diagnose or 'correct' what we might not fully understand.</p> <p><strong>Do Not Ridicule and Denigrate</strong></p> <p>It is fundamental that we avoid any form of mockery, contempt, or language that degrades those who experience uncommon emotional or neurological regulation needs. Ridiculing behaviors such as tics, regulatory movements, use of support devices, clothing items, personal care elements, or authentic emotional expressions not only causes deep harm, but directly contradicts the commandment to love one another as Christ loved us. Denigrating someone for their mental health or neurological condition—whether through words, gestures, subtle exclusions, or attitudes of superiority—is to deny the inherent dignity that each soul possesses as a son or daughter of God. Instead, <strong>we are called to cultivate an environment of reverent respect, where vulnerability is welcomed with tenderness</strong> and where difference is not tolerated, but celebrated as part of divine diversity in the human family.</p> <h3 id="our-christian-commitment"><a href="#our-christian-commitment" class="header-anchor">#</a> Our Christian Commitment</h3> <p><strong>Extending Unconditional Love</strong></p> <p>In consonance with The Family: A Proclamation to the World, we recognize that circumstances requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures or neurological conditions such as Tourette Syndrome need individual adaptation, and that other family members, as well as the community of saints, should provide support when needed.</p> <p>As a community of saints, we commit to:</p> <ul><li>Offer love without conditions or reservations</li> <li>Practice active empathy and genuine understanding toward neurological differences</li> <li>Strengthen bonds of brotherhood and love</li> <li>Make necessary adaptations according to individual circumstances</li> <li>Create safe spaces where all can heal and grow</li> <li>Foster understanding, inclusion for children and the rising generation</li> <li>Seek those who may have been affected by not knowing these things</li> <li>Accept that conditions like Tourette Syndrome require understanding, not correction</li></ul> <h3 id="guidance-for-leaders"><a href="#guidance-for-leaders" class="header-anchor">#</a> Guidance for Leaders</h3> <p>Local priesthood and auxiliary organization leaders should:</p> <ol><li>Receive with love and patience all members, regardless of their specific mental health and neurological needs</li> <li>Recognize that, according to The Family: A Proclamation to the World, circumstances requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures or neurological conditions such as Tourette Syndrome need individual adaptation</li> <li>Consider that neurological needs must be taken into account when identifying unusual or uncommon situations</li> <li>Consult with mental health and neurology professionals when appropriate and with the member's consent</li> <li>Make necessary physical and procedural adaptations in buildings and programs</li> <li>Educate congregations about the importance of inclusion and understanding of neurological differences</li> <li>Accompany families that require help in the individual adaptation process, in mutual understanding</li> <li>Facilitate extended family members and community members to provide support when needed</li> <li>Provide ongoing support resources and training on neurodiversity</li> <li>Understand that conditions like Tourette Syndrome require acceptance, not correction</li> <li>Identify situations of intolerance, due to not understanding the context, requires guidance and compassion for those affected</li></ol> <h3 id="message-of-hope"><a href="#message-of-hope" class="header-anchor">#</a> Message of Hope</h3> <p>We testify that the atonement of Jesus Christ encompasses all aspects of human suffering, including mental health struggles and neurological differences. Every person is precious in God's sight, and every path of healing and every form of neurological regulation is sacred when sought with faith and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p>We invite all families, wards, and stakes to become refuges of love, understanding, and support for those facing unique challenges in their mental health and neurological journey, including individuals with Tourette Syndrome and other neurodivergent conditions. In doing so, we not only bless the lives of others, but we also draw closer to the Christian ideal of true unity and love toward all human diversity.</p> <p>&quot;Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God&quot; (Romans 15:7).</p> <hr> <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p> <p><strong>The First Presidency</strong><br> <em>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em></p> <hr> <p><em>This statement should be read in all sacrament meetings and distributed to all local leaders for immediate implementation.</em></p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">9/23/2025, 2:41:57 PM</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
