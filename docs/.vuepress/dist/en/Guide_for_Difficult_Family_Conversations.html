Clarify your purpose</h4> <p>Before speaking, ask yourself:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>What do I hope to achieve with this conversation?</strong></p> <ul><li>✅ Healthy examples: &quot;That they understand me better&quot;, &quot;Reduce tension at home&quot;, &quot;Be able to participate more in family&quot;</li> <li>⚠️ Avoid unrealistic expectations: &quot;That they approve everything immediately&quot;, &quot;That they never have doubts again&quot;</li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>What do I need from them specifically?</strong></p> <ul><li>Examples: &quot;That they don't judge me when I use X strategy&quot;, &quot;That they respect my privacy&quot;, &quot;That they trust my professional judgment&quot;</li></ul></li></ul> <h4 id="_2-gather-supporting-information"><a href="#_2-gather-supporting-information" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Gather supporting information</h4> <ul><li>Documents from health professionals (if you have them and want to share them)</li> <li>Brief and accessible scientific articles</li> <li>InnerSight resources or other reliable sources</li> <li><strong>Important note:</strong> It's not mandatory to &quot;justify yourself&quot; with documentation. Your experience is valid.</li></ul> <h4 id="_3-choose-the-appropriate-time-and-place"><a href="#_3-choose-the-appropriate-time-and-place" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Choose the appropriate time and place</h4> <p>✅ <strong>Good times:</strong></p> <ul><li>When both are calm, not in a hurry</li> <li>In a private space where you won't be interrupted</li> <li>When you've slept well and feel emotionally stable</li></ul> <p>❌ <strong>Avoid:</strong></p> <ul><li>During heated discussions</li> <li>When someone is stressed about other topics</li> <li>Late at night when both are tired</li> <li>In public places if the topic is very personal</li></ul> <h4 id="_4-decide-how-much-information-to-share"><a href="#_4-decide-how-much-information-to-share" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Decide how much information to share</h4> <p>You don't have to explain everything at once. Consider sharing in stages:</p> <p><strong>First conversation:</strong></p> <ul><li>The general function (emotional regulation, calm, stability)</li> <li>That it's related to mental health/neurology, not morality</li> <li>That you have professional support (if that's the case)</li> <li>Your love for them and your family</li></ul> <p><strong>Subsequent conversations (as needed):</strong></p> <ul><li>More specific details</li> <li>Personal history if you feel comfortable</li> <li>Answers to questions that arise</li></ul> <hr> <h3 id="during-the-conversation"><a href="#during-the-conversation" class="header-anchor">#</a> During the Conversation</h3> <h4 id="how-to-begin-example-phrases"><a href="#how-to-begin-example-phrases" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to begin (example phrases)</h4> <p><strong>Option 1 - Direct but gentle:</strong></p> <blockquote><p>&quot;There's something important about me that I want to share with you. It's something related to my mental/neurological health that has taken me years to understand, and now that I understand it better, I want you to know it too.&quot;</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Option 2 - Establishing safety first:</strong></p> <blockquote><p>&quot;Before I begin, I want you to know that I love you and value our relationship. What I'm going to share may be difficult to understand at first, and it's okay if you need time to process it. I just ask you to listen with an open heart.&quot;</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Option 3 - Contextualizing with your story:</strong></p> <blockquote><p>&quot;For a long time I've dealt with something I didn't completely understand. Thanks to professional help, I now understand that I have specific emotional regulation needs related to [trauma/neurology]. I'd like to explain what this means for me.&quot;</p></blockquote> <h4 id="explain-the-function-not-just-the-form"><a href="#explain-the-function-not-just-the-form" class="header-anchor">#</a> Explain the function, not just the form</h4> <p>❌ <strong>Less effective:</strong></p> <blockquote><p>&quot;I need to use [specific object/strategy]&quot;</p></blockquote> <p>✅ <strong>More effective:</strong></p> <blockquote><p>&quot;My brain needs specific ways to regulate stress and emotional overload. For some people it's exercise, for others it's music.
