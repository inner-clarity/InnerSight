    <h2>Why am I addressing this topic now and not before?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Because now I have the professional/psychological and ecclesiastical validity guarantees that I never had before that support me (and clarify that <strong>I am not crazy</strong>). Before I felt vulnerable when raising the topic, or had to <strong>"hide it"</strong> because I didn't know how to explain it, and when raising it they added <strong>"more guilt"</strong> due to misunderstanding, because I was told that the trauma was <strong>wanting to use diapers</strong> (according to my wife)</li>
      <li>Because after making a deep reflection, I discovered the topic of "wanting to use diapers" as a <strong>"psychological mechanism of emotional regulation"</strong> I hadn't identified it before, and I carried <strong>unnecessary guilt</strong>, it wasn't a problem it was part of a solution</li>
      <li>Although it started with mindfulness, exercises: running, HIIT and adequate nutrition, I still feel that I lack that <strong>emotional regulation</strong> that I want to have in my life, the issue now is being <strong>understood</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to explain it to my wife?</h2>
    <p>I was thinking about how to tell my wife last week, so I wrote a <router-link to="/en/carta.html">letter</router-link>, (sincere, very frank and direct, and with the greatest delicacy possible) (because you told me to tell my wife), so I gave her the letter on Thursday morning I gave her the letter before going to work (printed on paper). She took time to read it (at her work), when she read it her messages started falling: <router-link to="/en/chat.html">WhatsApp chat</router-link></p>
    
    <p><strong>My conclusions or reflections:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>She didn't care about my life story, she thinks I invented it as an excuse (I feel she trampled my vulnerability)</li>
      <li>She doesn't believe everything I tell her about how I feel, she thinks <strong>it's her fault</strong> or what she does <strong>is not enough</strong></li>
      <li>She starts to feel uncomfortable (clashes with her internal model, and generates anxiety)</li>
      <li>She thinks there is a "treatment that starts and ends" and cures the problem</li>
      <li>She sees the diaper topic as the <strong>"main problem"</strong> or the trauma to overcome (but I see it as a <strong>"psychological mechanism of emotional regulation"</strong> to overcome traumas)</li>
      <li>She sees it as <strong>"wrong"</strong> (if she doesn't understand it then it's wrong for her)</li>
      <li>About having spoken to her before she thinks it was <strong>"therapy for me"</strong> because "I told her" (which I never saw as such), and she doesn't understand how I didn't "overcome it", because <strong>"it was solved"</strong> (according to her) (I had no way to refute anything or explain something I didn't understand and that's why I left it there)</li>
      <li>She thinks it's a fetish, an addiction, a trauma but this <router-link to="/en/analisis_psicologico_profundo.html">deep analysis shows why it's not</router-link></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The night talk about the topic</h2>
    <p>During the night we had a conversation in which she thought that "I had overcome it" (the trauma of "diapers"). She told me that:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>"I was being 'clever' because I liked wearing diapers, and I was taking advantage of the situation"</li>
      <li>"That she couldn't imagine or it didn't enter her head the image that if I had to ask for a priesthood blessing and she saw me wearing diapers it wouldn't look good, that she can't imagine it, that it wouldn't be worthy". <router-link to="/en/Sacerdocio_y_Salud_Mental.html">The priesthood doesn't stop working.</router-link></li>
      <li>"I already see that you've chosen, that you prefer that to us or your family, and in that we're not compatible, because I think differently"</li>
      <li>The next day she didn't allow our daughter to stay with me out of "fear that something would happen to her" and that she would no longer leave Ana "alone" with me because she became distrustful <router-link to="/en/Lo_Que_No_Es.html">she thinks it's something else</router-link></li>
      <li>Any attempt on my part to clarify the topic with the clarifications (that I mentioned earlier) is not accepted (only taken as justification for "my transgression")</li>
      <li>Also she became emotionally unstable (because she thought it was a "resolved" topic that "displaces" her) both of us couldn't sleep well at night, because she can't accept it or rejects it (just by thinking about it or the idea).</li>
      <li>She even denies me kisses because "she doesn't know what's going to happen now" with us, she denies me holding her hand in public</li>
      <li>I don't know if I was right in telling her or telling her like this (maybe it should have been gradual) because I didn't know how it would affect her, but at some point I would have to do it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Update:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Yesterday she saw how I'm putting this together (she grabbed my phone to "audit me", and saw my search to try to understand "what happens to me" and how to explain it, it's nothing against her).</li>
      <li>She thinks it's a conspiracy "against her" (this of making "diapers seem right" and she says it's "wrong and that's it") (a conspiracy against her on my part and yours).</li>
      <li>She told me that you "had promised" that "the diaper thing would disappear" (So she no longer believes in the system "that gave her reason" and that now "turned against her").</li>
      <li>She doesn't accept "any explanation" from anyone else, according to what she understands, what she thinks "is the only truth and it's right", and I'm wrong (she doesn't plan to change), that is, she doesn't care how I cope with the trauma situation.</li>
      <li>Everything arose (the "diapers") from having "more guarantees" and clarity about what was happening to me and how I "regulated my emotions" before without understanding why I did it (And that's why I looked for a way to balance it, and I denied that "need" to 'regulate my emotions' with diapers, because it wasn't 'acceptable' (according to my wife)).</li>
      <li>I do mindfulness, running and HIIT, and that helps me a lot, but with her "emotional ups and downs and friction" with my wife, now when I manage to understand that <strong>"it is not or should not be a burden, or it is not or should not be guilt"</strong>, the diaper topic I feel would give me that missing <strong>"emotional regulation"</strong>, but now <strong>"it's a controversial, incomprehensible and unacceptable topic"</strong> on her part.</li>
      <li>That's why now she wants separation, from here to a year (she says it because of detachment from my daughter), It's a situation that got out of control, she closes all possible help doors, only God knows our future. (I believe in miracles, the miracle of her understanding and acceptance). She doesn't accept therapy from anyone anymore, nor couple therapy. that's why she cancels everything.</li>
      <li>I think this will pass for her (that's what I hope), I know she's sensitive now because of the situation.</li>
