# Clarification on the Nature of Emotional Regulation Needs

## Introduction

Some people, when observing unfamiliar emotional regulation strategies, may wonder if these are related to sexual orientation. This question arises naturally when clinical information is lacking, but science and doctrine offer clarity.

Emotional regulation and sexual orientation belong to **distinct domains**: one is **intrapersonal and regulatory**, the other is **interpersonal and relational**. Understanding this difference helps avoid misunderstandings that can affect faith, belonging, and well-being of faithful members.

## What is emotional regulation?

Emotional regulation refers to the ways a person manages intense emotions or overwhelming sensations. It may include:
- Repetitive movements (such as rocking or hand rubbing)  
- Use of comfort objects or specific clothing  
- Rhythms, sounds, or symbolic behaviors  

Its purpose is to **restore internal calm**, not to express attraction to others. These strategies are common in people who have experienced trauma, have neurological differences (such as autism or Tourette's), or face sensory overload.

## What is sexual orientation?

Sexual orientation refers to the **pattern of emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction** toward people of a specific gender. It involves:
- Interpersonal desire  
- Affective bonds  
- Intention to connect with others  

It's not about isolated behaviors, but a persistent relational dimension.

## Key difference

> **Emotional regulation seeks internal safety; sexual orientation seeks connection with others.**

A regulatory behavior **does not imply attraction, desire, or sexual arousal**, even if its external form seems unusual. What defines its nature is its **internal function**, not its appearance.

## Clinical evidence

Mental health professionals evaluate whether a behavior is related to sexuality by observing:
- Does it occur in contexts of stress or intimacy?  
- Does it seek calm or pleasure?  
- Does it involve other people or is it something done alone?  
- Is there recurring attraction to others?  

When the answer is **calm, stress, solitude, and absence of attraction**, it confirms that the behavior is regulatory, not sexual.

### Examples of recognized conditions

- **Autism**: Repetitive movements (*stimming*) help manage overstimulation. Studies confirm they **are not associated with sexual attraction**, but with sensory needs (Kapp et al., 2019).  
- **PTSD**: Some people use objects or rituals that remind them of childhood to feel safe. This **is not sexual regression**, but seeking emotional containment (Van der Kolk, 2014).  
- **Tourette Syndrome**: Some tics may include unusual words or gestures, but **do not reflect the person's desires**. They are involuntary neurological discharges, like a sneeze.

## Gospel Principles

The Savior taught: *"Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment"* (John 7:24). This invites us not to assume motives based on what we see externally.

Additionally, *"The Lord looketh on the heart"* (1 Samuel 16:7). What matters before God is **intention and character**, not how a person regulates their emotions.

## Why this clarification matters

When a regulatory need is misinterpreted as if it were a sexual matter, the following can occur:
- Spiritual confusion  
- Isolation from family or congregation  
- Difficulty accepting help  
- Loss of trust in the ministering process  

That's why it's vital to **learn before assuming**, and **listen before judging**.

## Conclusion

Emotional regulation strategies, though they may seem unusual, **are not related to sexual orientation**. Recognizing this allows:
- Ministering with greater wisdom  
- Protecting the dignity of all God's children  
- Strengthening unity in Christ's flock
