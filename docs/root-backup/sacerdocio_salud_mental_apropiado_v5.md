# Spiritual Dignity and Mental Health

## Doctrinal Foundations

### "The Lord looketh on the heart"
Scripture teaches clearly that dignity before God does not depend on outward appearance, but on the heart (1 Samuel 16:7). This includes those facing mental health challenges, trauma, or neurological differences. What matters is intention, faith, and desire to follow Christ—not the way a person regulates their emotions.

### The Family Proclamation
*The Family: A Proclamation to the World* recognizes that "disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation." Mental health and neurological needs—including uncommon self-regulation strategies—clearly fall within "other circumstances" that justify understanding and support.

### The scope of the atonement
The Savior bore "our griefs and carried our sorrows" (Isaiah 53:4; Alma 7:11–12). His atonement encompasses not only sin, but all human suffering in its forms: physical, emotional, neurological, and spiritual.

## Priesthood Principles and Participation

### Criteria for spiritual dignity
Church manuals define priesthood dignity based on:
- Moral and spiritual righteousness  
- Obedience to commandments  
- Testimony of Jesus Christ  
- Desire to serve  

Notably, **there is no mention** of mental health conditions, self-regulation methods, or neurological differences as factors affecting dignity.

### Distinction between morality and medical need
The Church has consistently taught that there is a difference between:
- **Deliberate moral choices**, which require repentance  
- **Medical, neurological, or psychological needs**, which require understanding and support  

Confusing both can lead to incorrect judgments and unnecessary suffering.

## Recent Teachings from General Leaders

Current leaders have reinforced this approach with clarity:

> **Elder Jeffrey R. Holland**:  
> *"There is no shame in receiving help"* regarding mental health matters.  
> — *Like a Broken Vessel*, General Conference, October 2013

> **Sister Reyna I. Aburto**:  
> *"We never know what someone is facing. That's why we must be compassionate."*  
> — *Beyond Appearances*, General Conference, April 2019

> **Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf**:  
> *"Stop judging. Start ministering!"*  
> — *Come and See*, General Conference, October 2019

> **President Russell M. Nelson**:  
> *"Stop adding to the Gospel requirements things the Lord has not imposed."*  
> — *Let God Prevail*, General Conference, October 2020

These teachings invite us to **minister with humility**, not with assumptions.

## Clinical and Doctrinal Understanding

### Emotional regulation: a need, not a choice
Neuroscience shows that many self-regulation strategies—as in autism, Tourette Syndrome, or following trauma—are automatic nervous system responses, not conscious decisions. Attempting to suppress them without professional support can cause additional distress and spiritual distancing.

### Not a sexual matter
It is fundamental to understand that **emotional regulation strategies are not related to sexual orientation**. They do not involve attraction, desire, or arousal. Their purpose is to **restore internal calm**, not express interpersonal intimacy. Confusing them with sexual matters creates misunderstandings that affect faith and belonging.

### Impact on marriage
When a spouse feels pressured to abandon their regulatory needs, they may withdraw emotionally, even if their intention is to protect the relationship. **Mutual emotional security**—not conformity—is the foundation of full marital intimacy.

## Guidance for Leaders and Families

### For bishops and priesthood leaders
- Evaluate the individual's **overall dignity**, not their specific health needs  
- **Listen before judging**  
- **Consult with professionals** when appropriate, as you would with any other medical condition  
- **Make reasonable adjustments** in activities or spaces to allow full participation  
- Remember: your role is not to diagnose, but to **minister with love**

### For families
- Educate children in **compassion and human diversity**  
- Support your loved ones **without conditioning love on conformity**  
- Seek professional understanding when helpful  
- Remember that home should be a **refuge**, not a tribunal

## Benefits of Understanding

When Christ's Church supports all its members:
- Individuals can **serve according to their spiritual gifts**, without fear of being misunderstood  
- Families find **unity in diversity**  
- The Church testifies of **Christ's unconditional love**  
- The **spiritual unity** of the entire community is strengthened

## Conclusion

Mental health and neurological needs **do not diminish the spiritual dignity** of any person. Rather, how we treat them reveals our understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Supporting these faithful members does not mean approving everything, but **recognizing that each person's path is unique**, and that Christ's love has no conditions.

> "Receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God."  
> — **Romans 15:7**
