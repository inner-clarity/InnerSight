### Frequently Asked Questions for Leaders

**Q: Doesn't this open the door for anyone to justify any behavior?**
A: No. The document establishes clear clinical criteria: temporal consistency, professional supervision, maintenance of social roles, and absence of harm to others. Legitimate needs are verifiable by qualified professionals.

**Q: How do we differentiate between legitimate need and personal preference?**
A: [Specific DSM-5 criteria, neurological permanence, professional evaluation]

**Q: Does this contradict teachings about self-mastery?**
A: No. Self-mastery refers to conscious moral choices. Neurological adaptations are not "lack of control" but recognition of differences in how the brain functions.

**Q: What if a member claims to have a need but doesn't seek professional help?**
A: Gently encourage professional supervision, but don't condition support on this. Dignity doesn't require formal diagnosis.

**Q: Does this affect temple worthiness?**
A: Mental and neurological health conditions do not affect temple worthiness, which is based on testimony, obedience to commandments, and moral righteousness.

**Q: What if the member's family disagrees?**
A: [Guidance on family therapy, respect for both parties, not taking sides, focus on love and patience]

**Q: Do we have to allow EVERYTHING in Church activities?**
A: Reasonable accommodation is sought that allows dignified participation. Consult case by case with sensitivity and creativity.

**Q: Does this also apply to children and youth?**

A: **Yes, especially to children and youth**, for several reasons:

1. **Neurological development:** Many regulatory needs emerge in childhood ([autism](https://inner-clarity.github.io/ClearPath/en/autismo), [Tourette](https://inner-clarity.github.io/ClearPath/en/tourette), trauma responses)
2. **Increased vulnerability:** Youth are more susceptible to stigma and exclusion
3. **Importance of early intervention:** Early support prevents additional psychological damage
4. **Parent involvement:** Leaders should work with families, respecting that parents know their children best
5. **Adaptations in classes and activities:** Allow children with special needs to participate fully

**Special note:** Never use terms like "disorder" or "abnormal" in front of children. The language is: "Your brain works in a unique way, and that's okay."
