# Scientific Clarification: Emotional Regulation and Sexual Orientation Are Distinct Processes

## Academic Introduction

Some people, when observing unfamiliar emotional regulation strategies, may wonder if these are related to sexual orientation. However, clinical science and neuroscience clearly distinguish between these two domains: one is intrapersonal and regulatory, the other is interpersonal and relational.

This document offers a clear, evidence-based explanation to help leaders, families, and members understand this difference and avoid misunderstandings that could affect the faith and well-being of faithful people.

## Fundamental Scientific Definitions

### What is emotional regulation?

It is the set of ways a person manages intense emotions or overwhelming sensations. It can include repetitive movements, use of comfort objects, symbolic rituals, or specific sensory needs. Its purpose is to restore internal balance, not to express attraction toward others.

### What is sexual orientation?

**What is sexual orientation?**
It refers to the pattern of emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction toward people of a specific gender. It involves **interpersonal desire**, not just internal behaviors or automatic body responses.

**Key difference:**
Emotional regulation seeks **internal calm**; sexual orientation involves **connection with others**.

## Neuroscientific Framework of Differentiation

### The Brain Processes These Experiences Differently

Neuroscience shows that the brain uses **distinct circuits** for emotional regulation and sexual attraction.

- When a person seeks calm after stress, areas related to self-regulation and safety are activated.
- When there is attraction toward another person, reward and desire circuits are activated.

If a behavior **does not involve attraction toward others or sexual arousal**, it is not considered an expression of sexual orientation, regardless of its external appearance.

### Absence of Physiological Arousal

Mental health professionals assess whether a behavior is related to sexuality by observing if there is **recurrent desire or arousal**.
In most cases of emotional regulation—such as in autism, trauma, or Tourette—**there is no sexual component**, only a need for neurological balance.

## Differential Clinical Evidence

### Examples of Recognized Conditions

**Tourette Syndrome:**
Some tics may include words or gestures that seem inappropriate, but **they do not reflect the person's desires**. They are involuntary neurological discharges, like a sneeze.

**Autism:**
Repetitive movements (like rocking or rubbing hands) help manage overstimulation. Studies confirm that **they are not associated with sexual attraction**, but with sensory needs.

**PTSD:**
Some people use objects or behaviors that remind them of childhood to feel safe. This **does not imply sexual regression**, but a search for emotional containment.

### Standard Clinical Assessment

Professionals ask questions like:

- Does this behavior occur when you're stressed or when you seek intimacy?
- Does it generate calm or desire?
- Does it involve other people or is it something you do just for yourself?

The answers help distinguish between **regulatory need** and **sexual orientation**.

## Contemporary Diagnostic Framework

### DSM-5 and ICD-11: Categorical Clarity

Current clinical guidelines (DSM-5, ICD-11) emphasize that **the external appearance of a behavior does not define its internal purpose**. Only when there is recurrent sexual attraction is it considered a matter of sexual orientation or preference.

**Guiding principle:**
> "The symbolic appearance or external form of a behavior does not determine its internal motivation. Only the presence of recurrent sexual attraction justifies classification as a paraphilic disorder."

This distinction protects people with legitimate regulatory needs from being erroneously labeled as sexually deviant.

## Evolutionary and Functional Perspective

From a biological perspective:

- Emotional regulation helps to **survive in moments of stress**.
- Sexual orientation is related to **bond formation**.

They are distinct functions, although sometimes misinterpreted.

## Implications for Religious Practice

### Ministering with Understanding and Charity

The doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that "the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7). The Savior taught us not to judge by appearances (John 7:24). When a person uses a strategy to manage stress or anxiety, what matters is their intention and heart, not the external form of their behavior.

Supporting with understanding—instead of assuming motives—is an expression of "the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47). This demands **presumption of spiritual innocence** until there is clear evidence of deliberate moral choice, not neurological need.

### Harm from Erroneous Sexualization

**When a regulatory need is misinterpreted**
Some faithful members have felt that their spiritual belonging is questioned due to misunderstandings about their mental health needs. This can lead to:

- Isolation from family or congregation
- Difficulty accepting help
- Loss of trust in the ministering process

That is why it is vital to **learn before assuming, and listen before judging**.

## Scientific Conclusions

### Definitive Validation

Science and faith coincide on a fundamental principle: **each person deserves to be understood in their totality**.
Emotional regulation strategies, though they may seem unusual, are not related to sexual orientation. Recognizing this allows:

- Ministering with greater wisdom
- Protecting the dignity of all God's children
- Strengthening unity in Christ's flock

**The call is clear:**
Understand before judging. Validate before correcting. Love as the Savior would.

### Imperative for Informed Understanding

The religious and scientific community shares the responsibility to:

- Educate against automatic sexualization of the unusual
- Apply objective clinical criteria in behavior assessment
- Protect the dignity of those facing legitimate regulatory needs
- Promote inclusion based on evidence, not assumptions

**The call is clear:**
Understand before judging. Validate before correcting. Love before labeling.
