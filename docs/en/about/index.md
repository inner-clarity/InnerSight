# About InnerSight
<!-- i18n: synced with docs/es/about/index.md (Oct 2025). -->

InnerSight is an initiative of the InnerSight Foundation dedicated to exploring the intersection between mental health, emotional regulation processes —including those considered unconventional— and spiritual life within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

## Our Mission

Foster respectful, informed, and compassionate dialogue between contemporary clinical approaches and principles of ecclesiastical leadership in order to:

- Reduce stigma toward those who experience unique emotional or mental needs  
- Promote full inclusion and a sense of belonging for all children of God  
- Offer guidance that balances individual well-being with community harmony  
- Strengthen the Church as a refuge of Christlike love  

## Our Approach

This initiative arises from observing a real need: the lack of institutional understanding and structured support for members who, in their healing journey, use non-traditional methods of emotional regulation. Our work is grounded in:

- Scientifically validated principles of clinical psychology  
- Therapeutic approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy  
- Revealed doctrine and Christian values centered on empathy, charity, and human dignity  

We believe that faith and science are not in conflict, but can walk together to illuminate paths of healing, mutual understanding, and spiritual growth.
