# About InnerSight

InnerSight is a research initiative dedicated to examining the intersection between mental health, uncommon psychological procedures for emotional regulation, and the practice of religion within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

## Our Mission

Facilitate informed dialogue between professional clinical perspectives and ecclesiastical leadership to:

- **Reduce stigma** associated with unconventional methods of emotional regulation
- **Promote inclusion** of all members, regardless of their mental health needs
- **Establish clear guidelines** that harmonize individual well-being with community practice
- **Strengthen the community** through greater understanding and mutual support

## Professional Foundation

This work arises from the identified need for greater understanding and institutional support for members who use unconventional methods of emotional regulation as part of their healing and mental well-being process. The research is based on established principles of clinical psychology, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and revealed doctrine.
