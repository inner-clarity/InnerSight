# Scientific Foundation: Impact of Restriction of Regulatory Procedures on Marital Sexual Function

## Academic Introduction

Although uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures **do not constitute in themselves a sexual preference or behavior**, their **coercive restriction or chronic invalidation** can generate, indirectly but clinically significantly, **conflicts and sexual dysfunctions in marriage**. This analysis examines the scientific evidence that demonstrates how the suppression of legitimate regulatory needs interferes with the neurophysiological, emotional, and relational foundations of healthy marital intimacy.

## Fundamental Scientific Definitions

### Emotional Regulation vs. Sexual Function

**Emotional regulation (operational definition):**
- Set of neurological strategies to maintain nervous system homeostasis
- Primary function: internal security, not interpersonal attraction
- Does not imply desire, arousal, or sexual orientation

**Marital sexual function (operational definition):**
- Intimate expression of emotional connection, commitment, and mutual love
- Requires bodily presence, neurophysiological security, and shared agency
- Critically depends on prior emotional regulation

**Critical distinction:** Emotional regulation is a **prerequisite** for healthy sexual function, not its expression.

## Neuroscientific Framework of Interference

### Polyvagal Theory: Security as the Foundation of Intimacy

**Porges (2011)** research establishes that only in a state of **neurophysiological security** (mediated by the ventral vagus nerve) is interpersonal connection, bodily presence, and healthy sexual response possible.

**Consequences of regulatory restriction:**
- Activation of the sympathetic system (fight/flight)
- Physiological inhibition of sexual arousal
- Disconnection from the body as a protection mechanism
- Inability for the vulnerability necessary in intimacy

### Traumatic Neuroplasticity and Bodily Dissociation

**Van der Kolk (2014)** demonstrates that trauma—including relational trauma from chronic invalidation—permanently alters the person's relationship with their own body.

**Identified mechanisms:**
- Hyperactivation of the threat system
- Dissociation as a survival strategy
- Loss of interoception (internal bodily awareness)
- Association of the body with shame or correction

These changes **directly inhibit** the capacity to experience pleasure, presence, and connection during marital intimacy.

## Differential Clinical Evidence

### Chronic Stress and Secondary Sexual Dysfunction

**Chronic emotional invalidation** is a robust predictor of relational stress, which in turn is associated with multiple forms of sexual dysfunction:

- Decreased desire (especially in commitment contexts)
- Difficulty with arousal or orgasm
- Avoidance of physical intimacy as protection

**Basson (2000)** establishes that in stable relationships, sexual desire frequently arises **from emotional security and receptivity**, not as spontaneous impulse. If emotional regulation is blocked, that gateway to desire closes.

### Loss of Agency and Sexual Authenticity

**Meston & Stanton (2018)** demonstrate that **perceived autonomy** is a key predictor of sexual satisfaction in marriage. When a person represses their regulatory needs to be accepted, they internalize a narrative of **inauthenticity**, which inhibits spontaneous and genuine sexual expression.

### Marital Conflict from Internal Dissonance

**Gottman & Silver (1999)** identify **lack of mutual validation** as one of the four main predictors of divorce. The invalidation of regulatory needs—though not sexual—undermines the emotional foundation of marriage, including its intimate dimension.

## Contemporary Emotional Regulation Framework

### Neural Automation and Resistance to Forced Change

**Gross (2015)** research confirms that regulatory strategies are **neurologically automated** and not easily modifiable by conscious will. Demanding their abandonment without professional intervention generates:

- Accumulation of undischarged neurological tension
- Chronic activation of the threat system
- Progressive deterioration of marital connection

### Functionality as Intervention Criterion

The **DSM-5 (APA, 2013)** establishes that pathology is defined by **dysfunctionality**, not by appearance. If a regulatory procedure **maintains emotional stability and relational capacity**, its restriction lacks clinical foundation and can cause iatrogenic harm.

## Evolutionary and Adaptive Perspective

### Optimization for Survival, not for Convention

**Gilbert (2019)** argues that regulatory strategies evolve to **maximize survival in specific contexts**, not to comply with social norms. Coercively restricting them reduces individual resilience and, by extension, marital stability.

### Regulatory Diversity as Relational Resource

Diversity in forms of self-regulation can, when understood and validated, become a **source of empathy, mutual adaptation, and joint spiritual growth** in marriage.

## Implications for Religious Practice

### Harmony between Science, Doctrine, and Marriage

Gospel doctrine emphasizes **unconditional love**, **mutual understanding**, and the **sanctity of the body** (1 Corinthians 6:19–20). Forcing the abandonment of legitimate regulatory needs contradicts these principles and damages the marital intimacy that celestial marriage seeks to protect.

### Evidence-Based Support Framework

Scientific research provides clear guidelines for couples and leaders:

- **Validate before correcting**
- **Seek professional understanding when appropriate**
- **Protect emotional security as the foundation of intimacy**
- **Reject coercion as a method of change**

---

## Scientific Conclusions

### Validation of Transversal Interference

Contemporary scientific evidence establishes that:

- Coercive restriction of regulatory procedures **does not directly cause** sexual dysfunction
- But **does transversally interfere** with the neurophysiological and emotional prerequisites of marital intimacy
- This interference is **predictable, measurable, and preventable**

### Imperative of Marital Inclusion

Recognizing regulatory needs as **legitimate and non-sexual** is essential for:

- Protecting individual emotional stability
- Strengthening marital connection
- Preventing secondary sexual dysfunctions
- Honoring the sanctity of marriage as a covenant of love and understanding

### Call to Integrated Understanding

The religious and scientific community shares the responsibility to apply contemporary knowledge to protect **both individual dignity and marital integrity**.

**The imperative is clear:**
Marital intimacy flourishes not in forced conformity, but in **mutual emotional security**, built on the **validation of each spouse's legitimate neurological needs**.
