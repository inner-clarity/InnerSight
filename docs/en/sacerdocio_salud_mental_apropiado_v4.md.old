# Priesthood and Mental Health: Principles of Doctrinal Inclusion

## Doctrinal Foundations

### The Principle of Heart vs. External Appearance

The doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints clearly establishes that "the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7). This fundamental principle indicates that spiritual dignity is measured by righteousness of intentions and moral character, not by external circumstances or health needs.

### Precedents of Inclusion

The Church has consistently established that medical conditions, physical disabilities, or health circumstances do not affect priesthood dignity. This includes:

- Members who require medical devices
- People with neurological or psychiatric conditions (including Tourette Syndrome, autism, ADHD)
- Individuals with specific personal care needs
- Those who require medication for mental health
- People with neurological differences that require specific self-regulation mechanisms

## Harmony with "The Family: A Proclamation to the World"

The Family Proclamation explicitly recognizes that "disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation." This doctrinal statement establishes the precedent for understanding that mental health needs requiring uncommon emotional regulation procedures fall within the framework of "other circumstances" that justify individual adaptation.

## Principles of Priesthood Dignity

### Established Doctrinal Criteria

Church manuals establish that priesthood dignity is based on:

- **Moral and spiritual righteousness**
- **Obedience to commandments**
- **Testimony of Jesus Christ**
- **Desire to serve**

**Notably absent:** Any reference to specific configurations of mental health or emotional self-regulation needs.

### Differentiation Between Moral and Medical

Church doctrine makes a clear distinction between:

- **Deliberate moral choices** that affect dignity
- **Medical or psychological needs** that require adaptation and understanding

This differentiation is fundamental to understanding how mental health conditions relate to religious participation.

## Framework of Healing Principles

### The Atonement and Mental Health Conditions

The doctrine of the atonement explicitly includes healing of "sicknesses" and "infirmities" (Isaiah 53:4; Alma 7:11-12). This encompasses:

- Psychological trauma and its lasting effects
- Emotional regulation needs developed as adaptive response
- Neurological conditions like Tourette Syndrome that require specific self-regulation mechanisms
- Healing processes that may require unconventional methods such as the use of:
  - Specific clothing items
  - Medical or therapeutic devices
  - Bandages or support products
  - Diapers or other personal care accessories
  - Any other elements not mentioned here necessary for emotional or neurological regulation
- Inherent neurological differences that need adaptation and understanding

### Savior's Precedent

Scriptural accounts demonstrate that Christ consistently healed without judging the circumstances that led to the person's condition. His approach was healing and inclusion, not judgment of adaptations necessary for well-being.

## Do not confuse neurological emotional regulation with sexual attraction

### Fundamental clinical and doctrinal distinction

It is essential to understand that **uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures do not constitute a preference, orientation, or sexual attraction**. This confusion—though frequent—lacks both scientific and doctrinal foundation, and its persistence generates spiritual, emotional, and community harm.

From a clinical perspective, **emotional regulation** and **sexual orientation** belong to distinct neurological and psychological domains. The first seeks to restore nervous system homeostasis in response to stress, trauma, or sensory overload; the second refers to stable patterns of emotional or romantic attraction (APA, 2021). There is no evidence that strategies such as stimming in autism, symbolic rituals following trauma, or use of transitional objects in adulthood are motivated by sexual desire (Kapp et al., 2019; Van der Kolk, 2014).

### Harmful effect of erroneous sexualization

When a legitimate regulatory need is interpreted as if it were an expression of sexual attraction, it produces:

- **Unnecessary stigmatization** of already vulnerable people
- **Spiritual exclusion** based on misunderstandings
- **Inappropriate interventions** that ignore the true function of the behavior (self-regulation, not sexual expression)
- **Loss of trust** in leaders and faith communities

This type of error directly contradicts the mandate to "look on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7) and the principle of charity (Moroni 7:47), as it judges external appearance without understanding internal intention.

### Impact on marital intimacy when coercively restricted

Although these procedures **are not sexual**, their **coercive restriction** —through emotional blackmail, spiritual pressure, or unrevealed demands— can **indirectly erode marital intimacy**. Contemporary science shows that emotional self-regulation is a neurological prerequisite for intimate connection in marriage (Porges, 2011; Basson, 2000).

When a person cannot access their essential regulatory mechanisms, their nervous system enters states of **hyperactivation or dissociation**, which physiologically inhibit bodily presence, emotional security, and the capacity for vulnerability necessary for intimacy. This can generate:

- Loss of secondary sexual desire due to chronic stress
- Avoidance of physical closeness as a protection mechanism
- Resentment or emotional disconnection between spouses

On the contrary, **validating and respecting** each spouse's regulatory needs strengthens mutual trust, restores emotional security, and creates the conditions for full, consensual, and sacred marital intimacy.

### Doctrinal clarity versus cultural assumptions

Church doctrine **has never taught** that mental health or neurological needs should be interpreted as moral or sexual issues. On the contrary, official manuals and teachings emphasize the distinction between **deliberate moral choices** and **medical or psychological needs**.

Confusing an adaptive response to trauma with a sexual preference —or coercively restricting it without understanding— is not only clinically incorrect, but adds an **unnecessary burden** that the Lord has not imposed (see teachings of President Russell M. Nelson about not adding unrevealed rules). This confusion can distance souls from the Savior, not because of their actions, but because of the lack of understanding of those who should be their first defenders.

### Path of restoration: informed understanding

The remedy is **precise clinical and doctrinal education**:

- Recognize that the absence of sexual arousal during regulatory behavior is a key diagnostic criterion (WHO, ICD-11)
- Understand that the function reported by the person—calm, safety, containment—defines its nature, not its external form
- Apply the principle of **spiritual presumption of innocence** until there is clear evidence of deliberate moral choice

In doing so, we reflect the Savior's ministry, who never required explanations before healing, nor judged the ways people sought relief.

## Practical Application in Leadership

### For Priesthood Leaders

Local leaders should:

- **Distinguish between morality and mental health**
- **Consult with professionals when appropriate**
- **Focus on the individual's general dignity**
- **Provide compassionate support**
- **Make necessary adaptations according to circumstances**

### Evaluation Criteria

When considering priesthood dignity, leaders should evaluate:

- ✅ General moral righteousness
- ✅ Commitment to the Gospel
- ✅ Desire to serve and bless others
- ✅ Testimony of Christ

**NOT evaluate:**
- ❌ Specific mental health needs
- ❌ Methods of emotional self-regulation
- ❌ Adaptations required by trauma or circumstances
- ❌ Neurological differences like Tourette Syndrome
- ❌ Involuntary movements or necessary regulatory behaviors
- ❌ Unconventional forms of self-regulation that lack sexual component

## Benefits of Doctrinal Understanding

### For Individuals

- Greater inclusion in church participation
- Reduction of stigma associated with mental health needs
- Strengthening of testimony through acceptance
- Ability to serve according to spiritual gifts

### For the Community

- Demonstration of Christian love in action
- Testimony of principles of charity and inclusion
- Strengthening of the concept that "all are alike unto God" (2 Nephi 26:33)
- Model of understanding for other special needs
- Creation of truly inclusive spaces for neurodivergent individuals
- Testimony of acceptance toward neurological differences like Tourette Syndrome

## Guidance for Families

### Family Understanding

Families can support members with mental health needs through:

- **Education about trauma, neuroplasticity and neurological conditions**
- **Separation between moral and medical/neurological considerations**
- **Individual adaptation and adaptation of other family members according to their age**
- **Focus on mutual spiritual growth**
- **Seeking professional understanding when necessary**
- **Understanding that conditions like Tourette Syndrome require acceptance, not correction**

### Strengthening Relationships

These experiences can strengthen family bonds by:

- Developing greater empathy and understanding
- Deepening commitment to mutual support
- Demonstrating unconditional love in action
- Creating opportunities for joint spiritual growth

## Doctrinal Conclusion

The doctrinal principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints completely support the inclusion of individuals with mental health and neurological needs, including those who require uncommon emotional regulation procedures or have conditions like Tourette Syndrome.

These needs:

- **DO NOT** constitute moral transgressions
- **DO NOT** affect priesthood dignity
- **DO NOT** represent sexual preferences
- **DO** deserve understanding and support
- **CAN** coexist with full spiritual life
- **DO** represent legitimate neurological diversity that requires acceptance

The implementation of these principles strengthens both individuals and the community, demonstrating the highest ideals of Christian love and divine inclusion toward all human diversity, including neurological differences.
