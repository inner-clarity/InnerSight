# Propose of statement from The First Presidency

## On Inclusion, Understanding, and Acceptance of Individuals with Mental Health Conditions

---

**To priesthood leaders and auxiliary organizations worldwide:**

Dear brothers and sisters,

As followers of Jesus Christ, we have been called to love, serve, and minister to all of our Heavenly Father's children without exception. The Savior Himself taught us: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28). This fundamental principle must guide our understanding and support for those members of our community who face unique mental health and neurological challenges, including conditions such as Tourette Syndrome, autism, ADHD, and other neurological differences.

### Principles of Inclusion and Understanding

**Harmony with The Family: A Proclamation to the World**

These principles are in perfect harmony with The Family: A Proclamation to the World, which recognizes that "disability, death, or other circumstances (such as those requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures) may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended family members should provide support when needed."

**Full Access to Priesthood and Ordinances**

We reaffirm that mental health and neurological conditions, including those requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures or conditions such as Tourette Syndrome, do not deprive any worthy member of access to the priesthood or sacred ordinances. This includes situations where a person's emotional or neurological wellbeing requires:

- Specific clothing items
- Medical or therapeutic devices
- Bandages or support products
- Diapers or other personal care accessories
- Any other elements necessary for emotional or neurological regulation
- Involuntary movements or necessary regulatory behaviors (such as tics in Tourette Syndrome)

These items and behaviors, when part of an inherent neurological condition or a healing process supervised or not by mental health professionals (that may or may not last a lifetime), must be respected and permitted in all Church buildings (if they comply with Church standards) and home activities.

### Call to Empathy and Understanding

**Do Not Judge**

We urge all members, leaders, and families to refrain from making judgments about mental health and neurological situations that may seem uncommon or difficult to understand, including conditions such as Tourette Syndrome, involuntary movements, or specific regulatory needs. Let us remember that "man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).

**Do Not Exclude**

No behavior related to mental health conditions or neurological differences should be grounds for exclusion from our congregations, activities, or worship services, even in family settings. Diversity in forms of healing, recovery, and neurological regulation **should be seen as a manifestation of our Heavenly Father's infinite compassion**.

**Do Not Misinterpret**

We recognize that we often do not know the background, trauma, neurological conditions, or circumstances that have led a person to need uncommon specific forms of emotional or neurological regulation. It should not be seen as "Teaching this is wrong and is trauma for children and the rising generation." Instead of making assumptions, **we should approach with humility and genuine desire to understand.**

### Our Christian Commitment

**Extending Unconditional Love**

In consonance with The Family: A Proclamation to the World, we recognize that circumstances requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures or neurological conditions such as Tourette Syndrome need individual adaptation, and that other family members, as well as the community of saints, should provide support when needed.

As a community of saints, we commit to:

- Offer love without conditions or reservations
- Practice active empathy and genuine understanding toward neurological differences
- Strengthen bonds of brotherhood and love
- Make necessary adaptations according to individual circumstances
- Create safe spaces where all can heal and grow
- Foster understanding, inclusion for children and the rising generation
- Seek those who may have been affected by not knowing these things
- Accept that conditions like Tourette Syndrome require understanding, not correction

### Guidance for Leaders

Local priesthood and auxiliary organization leaders should:

1. Receive with love and patience all members, regardless of their specific mental health and neurological needs
2. Recognize that, according to The Family: A Proclamation to the World, circumstances requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures or neurological conditions such as Tourette Syndrome need individual adaptation
3. Consult with mental health and neurology professionals when appropriate and with the member's consent
4. Make necessary physical and procedural adaptations in buildings and programs
5. Educate congregations about the importance of inclusion and understanding of neurological differences
6. Accompany families that require help in the individual adaptation process, in mutual understanding
7. Facilitate extend family members and community members to provide support when needed
8. Provide ongoing support resources and training on neurodiversity
9. Understand that conditions like Tourette Syndrome require acceptance, not correction

### Message of Hope

We testify that the atonement of Jesus Christ encompasses all aspects of human suffering, including mental health struggles and neurological differences. Every person is precious in God's sight, and every path of healing and every form of neurological regulation is sacred when sought with faith and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

We invite all families, wards, and stakes to become refuges of love, understanding, and support for those facing unique challenges in their mental health and neurological journey, including individuals with Tourette Syndrome and other neurodivergent conditions. In doing so, we not only bless the lives of others, but we also draw closer to the Christian ideal of true unity and love toward all human diversity.

"Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God" (Romans 15:7).
