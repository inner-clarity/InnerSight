# Propose of statement from The First Presidency

## On Inclusion, Understanding, and Acceptance of Individuals with Mental Health Conditions

---

**To priesthood leaders and auxiliary organizations worldwide:**

Dear brothers and sisters,

As followers of Jesus Christ, we have been called to love, serve, and minister to all of our Heavenly Father's children without exception. The Savior Himself taught us: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28). This fundamental principle must guide our understanding and support for those members of our community who face unique mental health challenges.

### Principles of Inclusion and Understanding

**Harmony with The Family: A Proclamation to the World**

These principles are in perfect harmony with The Family: A Proclamation to the World, which recognizes that "disability, death, or other circumstances (such as those requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures) may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended family members should provide support when needed."

**Full Access to Priesthood and Ordinances**

We reaffirm that mental health conditions, including those requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures, do not deprive any worthy member of access to the priesthood or sacred ordinances. This includes situations where a person's emotional wellbeing requires the use of:

- Specific clothing items
- Medical or therapeutic devices
- Bandages or support products
- Diapers or other personal care accessories
- Any other elements necessary for emotional regulation

These items, when part of a treatment or healing process supervised by mental health professionals, must be respected and permitted in all Church buildings and home activities.

### Call to Empathy and Understanding

**Do Not Judge**

We urge all members, leaders, and families to refrain from making judgments about mental health situations that may seem uncommon or difficult to understand. Let us remember that "man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).

**Do Not Exclude**

No behavior related to mental health conditions should be grounds for exclusion from our congregations, activities, or worship services. Diversity in forms of healing and recovery should be seen as a manifestation of our Heavenly Father's infinite compassion.

**Do Not Misinterpret**

We recognize that we often do not know the background, trauma, or circumstances that have led a person to need specific forms of emotional regulation. Instead of making assumptions, we should approach with humility and genuine desire to understand.

### Our Christian Commitment

**Extending Unconditional Love**

In consonance with The Family: A Proclamation to the World, we recognize that circumstances requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures need individual adaptation, and that extended family members, as well as the community of Saints, should provide support when needed.

As a community of Saints, we commit to:

- Offer love without conditions or reservations
- Practice active empathy and genuine understanding
- Strengthen bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood
- Make necessary adaptations according to individual circumstances
- Create safe spaces where all can heal and grow

### Guidance for Leaders

Local priesthood and auxiliary organization leaders should:

1. Receive with love and patience all members, regardless of their specific mental health needs
2. Recognize that, according to The Family: A Proclamation to the World, circumstances requiring uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures need individual adaptation
3. Consult with mental health professionals when appropriate and with the member's consent
4. Make necessary physical and procedural adaptations in buildings and programs
5. Educate congregations about the importance of inclusion and understanding
6. Facilitate extended family members and community members to provide support when needed
7. Provide ongoing support resources and training

### Message of Hope

We testify that the atonement of Jesus Christ encompasses all aspects of human suffering, including mental health struggles. Every person is precious in God's sight, and every path of healing is sacred when sought with faith and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

We invite all families, wards, and stakes to become refuges of love, understanding, and support for those facing unique challenges in their mental health journey. In doing so, we not only bless the lives of others, but we also draw closer to the Christian ideal of true unity and love.

"Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God" (Romans 15:7).
