# InnerSight  
## Informed Support for the Inclusion of All God's Children  

An educational resource to better understand mental health and neurological needs in the context of the Gospel

---

### Purpose

InnerSight is an educational resource that seeks to support leaders, families, and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in better understanding how neurological differences and trauma responses may require legitimate forms of emotional regulation. This work is based on clinical evidence, Gospel principles, and the shared desire to minister with Christ-like love.

### Foundation

This resource responds to common questions from leaders and families about how to support faithful members whose mental health or neurological needs require specific adaptations. It is based on recognized clinical standards (such as the DSM-5), neuroscience research, and principles of the restored Gospel.

### Testimonies

> **Brother reflective**: \
> "I am a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood, I have served in multiple callings. My neurological condition requires specific adaptations for sensory regulation. For years I felt shame, until a understanding bishop told me: 'Your dignity before God does not depend on your neurodiversity'. Those words changed my life."

> **Faithful member**: \
> "In an interview with a leader, when I raised the need to use personal care items (PEPT), this leader questioned the legitimacy and made it clear that it was 'contrary for a worthy priesthood holder to use that or that it would look bad, or that it would be embarrassing' without understanding that it was not a whim but a neurological need. Although I felt misunderstood, I felt that God DOES know what is happening to me and that He DOES understand my heart."

> **Returned missionary**: \
> "During my mission, I was exposed to situations that made others uncomfortable, sometimes I have tics, I even emit unconscious verbal sounds (Tourette's Syndrome). There were leaders who called my attention for 'disrespecting or being irreverent' but I did it involuntarily, I would have liked them to be informed about these neurological conditions. I am grateful to have had a loving and understanding mission president, I have had very patient companions, they made me feel that the Savior was taking care of me. I finished my mission with honor"

> **Selfless mother**: \
> "Many have told me 'why I didn't keep my son quiet' or that 'I was a bad mother' because I don't control my son (my son has autism), they even suggested the possibility of not going to church anymore. They don't understand everything I go through daily, even so I receive strength from a Heavenly Father who loves me, the strength of a loving, faithful and good father husband, and the promise that if I remain faithful 'The Lord will carry me on his shoulders'. If others could have greater understanding, I would feel my burden a little lighter. But above all, I know that the Savior understands me perfectly, and that gives me peace."

## Main Content

### [Psychological Foundations](/en/analisis_psicologico_apropiado_v2)
This section presents a clinical perspective on how people regulate their emotions, especially when they have experienced trauma or have neurological differences. It explains when certain responses are necessary adaptive strategies—not disorders—according to current medical criteria, including neuroscience and international diagnostic guidelines.

### [Clinical Understanding of Emotional Regulation Needs](/en/fundamento_cientifico_validacion)
Evidence-based guide to recognize when certain behaviors reflect neurological needs or trauma responses, rather than personal preferences. Includes clinical criteria, illustrative examples, and guidance for leaders and families who wish to minister with understanding.

### [Impact of Demanding Abandonment of Necessary Regulatory Strategies](/en/efectos_de_restricciones_coercitiva)

### [When Love is Conditioned on Conformity](/en/chantaje_emocional)

### [Nature of Emotional Regulation](/en/naturaleza_regulacion_emocional)
