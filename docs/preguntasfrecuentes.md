## Frequently Asked Questions for Leaders

### About Criteria and Differentiation

**Q: Doesn't this open the door for anyone to justify any behavior?**
**A:** No. The document establishes clear clinical criteria:
temporal consistency, professional supervision, maintenance
of social roles, and absence of harm to others. Legitimate needs
are verifiable by qualified professionals.

**Q: How do we differentiate between legitimate need and personal preference?**

**A:** The difference is established through objective clinical criteria:

1. Temporal consistency: The need is present for months or years, it's not a momentary preference
1. Resistance to voluntary change: It doesn't disappear with "willpower" or social pressure
1. Verifiable neurological basis: Associated with documented trauma, diagnosed neurological condition, or atypical neurological development pattern
1. Functionality maintenance: The person fulfills social, work and family roles effectively
1. Professional supervision: When possible, validated by specialists in trauma, neurology or psychiatry
1. Absence of harm to third parties: Doesn't cause physical or emotional harm to others

According to DSM-5, pathology is defined by dysfunction, not by deviation from social norms. If a strategy allows effective functioning and well-being, it doesn't constitute a disorder regardless of its external appearance.

**Q: What if a member uses this as an "excuse" for inappropriate behavior?**

**A:** It's important to distinguish between legitimate needs and misuse of mental health concepts:

**Legitimate need:**

- Consistent and documentable pattern
- Doesn't cause intentional harm to others
- The person seeks or accepts professional help
- Maintains basic responsibilities

**Misuse of the concept:**

- Inconsistent or convenient justification
- Deliberate harm to others
- Total rejection of any support or limit
- Severe functional deterioration without seeking help

If there's genuine doubt, the leader should consult with LDS Family Services professionals, always maintaining respect for the individual's dignity.

### About Doctrine and Worthiness

**Q: Does this contradict teachings about self-mastery?**
**A:** No. Self-mastery refers to conscious moral choices.
Neurological adaptations are not "lack of control" but
recognition of differences in how the brain functions.

**Q: Does this affect temple worthiness?**
**A:** Mental and neurological health conditions don't affect
temple worthiness, which is based on testimony, obedience
to commandments, and moral righteousness.



### About Family and Community

**Q: What if the member's family doesn't agree?**
**A:** This is one of the most difficult scenarios. Leaders should:

1. **Not take sides**: The leader's role is not to resolve family conflicts, but to minister to all with love
2. **Validate both experiences**:

- For the member: "I understand this is a real need for you"
- For the family: "I understand this is difficult to comprehend"

3. **Recommend professional help**: Suggest family therapy with mental health specialists
4. **Remember doctrinal principles**:

- "By persuasion, by long-suffering" (D&C 121:41)
- No pressure or ultimatum reflects Christ's love

**Q: How do we balance individual support with congregation comfort?**

**A:** Christ's Church must be refuge for all. Guiding principles:

1. Priority: Inclusion of vulnerable members takes precedence over "comfort" based on ignorance
2. Education: When there's discomfort, the response is to gently educate the congregation about neurological diversity
3. Reasonable accommodations: Similar to how we adapt for physical disabilities (ramps, interpreters), we adapt for neurological needs
4. Privacy: Most regulatory needs don't require public explanation; simply respect for privacy
5. Doctrinal reminder: "Judge not according to the appearance" (John 7:24)

If "discomfort" persisted after education, the problem is with those who judge, not with those who have the need.

4. **Protect the vulnerable member**: If there are threats of abandonment, coercion or emotional violence, the leader must intervene pastorally
5. **Long-term patience**: Family understanding can take time; the process shouldn't be rushed

**Key principle**: The member's dignity before God doesn't depend on family consensus. Unity is sought through mutual understanding, not through forced conformity.

### About Practical Implementation

**Q: Do we have to allow EVERYTHING in Church activities?**
**A:** Reasonable accommodation is sought that allows dignified participation.
Consult case by case with sensitivity and creativity.

**Q: What if a member claims to have a need but doesn't seek professional help?**
**A:** Gently encourage professional supervision, but don't
condition support on this. Dignity doesn't require formal
diagnosis.

**Q: Does this also apply to children and youth?**

**A: Yes, especially to children and youth**, for several reasons:

1. **Neurological development:** Many regulatory needs emerge in childhood ([autism](https://inner-clarity.github.io/ClearPath/en/autismo), [Tourette](https://inner-clarity.github.io/ClearPath/en/tourette), trauma responses)
2. **Increased vulnerability:** Youth are more susceptible to stigma and exclusion
3. **Importance of early intervention:** Early support prevents additional psychological harm
4. **Parental involvement:** Leaders should work with families, respecting that parents know their children best
5. **Adaptations in classes and activities:** Allow children with special needs to participate fully

**Special note:** Never use terms like "disorder" or "abnormal" in front of children. The language is: "Your brain works in a unique way, and that's okay."
