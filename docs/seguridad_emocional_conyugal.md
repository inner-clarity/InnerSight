# Emotional Marital Security

## Introduction

Marriage is a sacred covenant founded on love, trust, and mutual commitment. For this union to thrive, each spouse needs to feel **safe to be authentic**, without fear of being judged, corrected, or rejected for their internal needs.

When one spouse faces mental health challenges or neurological differences—such as trauma responses, autism, or Tourette syndrome—they may depend on certain strategies to maintain their emotional equilibrium. If these needs are **misunderstood, minimized, or conditioned on acceptance**, the emotional foundation of the marriage can be affected.

This document explains, from a clinical and doctrinal perspective, why **mutual emotional security** is essential for marital stability, and how compassionate support strengthens the bond between husband and wife.

## Fundamental Principles

### Security as the Foundation of Connection

Contemporary neuroscience shows that people can only be fully present in a relationship when they feel **safe at a physiological and emotional level**. This security doesn't depend on external conformity, but on **mutual validation**.

When a spouse suppresses their regulatory needs to avoid conflict or gain approval, they may:
- Withdraw emotionally
- Feel alone even in the other's presence
- Lose confidence in their ability to be loved as they are

This doesn't reflect a lack of love, but a natural response to perceived insecurity.

### Marriage as Refuge, Not Tribunal

Gospel doctrine teaches that the home should be a **refuge from the world**, not a place where tests of "normality" or "spiritual strength" are imposed. The Savior never conditioned His love on behavioral perfection.

As *The Family: A Proclamation to the World* teaches, marriage should be based on "love, compassion, and mutual support." This includes making space for **individual differences**, especially when related to mental or neurological health.

## Relevant Clinical Evidence

### The Impact of Chronic Invalidation

Studies in relational psychology (Gottman & Silver, 1999) identify **lack of mutual validation** as one of the main predictors of marital deterioration. This doesn't refer to disagreements, but to the persistent feeling that "what I feel doesn't matter."

When a spouse feels they must hide or suppress their needs to be accepted, they may:
- Avoid emotional closeness
- Develop chronic anxiety in the relationship
- Lose the ability to express their true feelings

This is not "lack of faith," but an understandable human response to perceived conditionality in love.

### The Importance of Authenticity

Research shows that **marital satisfaction** is closely tied to the perception of being able to be oneself with one's partner (Meston & Stanton, 2018). Authenticity doesn't mean absence of effort, but the freedom to be vulnerable without fear of rejection.

When both spouses feel safe to share their struggles—including emotional regulation needs—the relationship is strengthened, not weakened.

## Support Based on Gospel Principles

### Unconditional Love in Practice

The Apostle Paul taught that charity "beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things" (1 Corinthians 13:7). This doesn't mean tolerating harm, but **seeking understanding before correction**.

In the context of marriage, this translates to:
- Listening without judging
- Asking before assuming
- Supporting without demanding immediate change
- Seeking professional help when useful

### The Body as Temple

The Scriptures teach that "your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost" (1 Corinthians 6:19). This includes respecting how each person experiences and regulates their emotions. Forcing the abandonment of essential regulatory strategies can make a spouse feel in conflict with their own body, which affects their spiritual and marital well-being.

## Recommendations for Couples

- **Converse with empathy**: Ask: "What do you need to feel at peace?" instead of "Why do you do that?"
- **Seek professional understanding**: A trained therapist can help both spouses understand underlying needs.
- **Focus on connection, not correction**: The goal is not to eliminate what seems "unusual," but to strengthen mutual trust.
- **Remember the purpose of marriage**: It's not to achieve perfection, but to grow together in love, faith, and understanding.

## Conclusion

Marital intimacy—in its fullest sense—flourishes not in uniformity, but in **mutual emotional security**. When each spouse feels free to be authentic without fear of being rejected, marriage becomes a true refuge of Christ's love.

Supporting legitimate emotional regulation needs doesn't weaken marriage; on the contrary, **it strengthens it by building a foundation of trust, respect, and shared dignity**.
