# About InnerSight

InnerSight is a research initiative dedicated to examining the intersection between mental health, uncommon psychological emotional regulation procedures, and religious practice within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

## Our Mission

Facilitate informed dialogue between professional clinical perspectives and ecclesiastical leadership to:

- **Reduce stigma** associated with unconventional emotional regulation methods
- **Promote inclusion** of all members, regardless of their mental health needs
- **Establish clear guidelines** that harmonize individual well-being with community practice
- **Strengthen community** through greater understanding and mutual support

## Professional Foundation

This work arises from the identified need for greater understanding and institutional support for members who use unconventional methods of emotional regulation as part of their healing process and mental well-being. The research is based on established principles of clinical psychology, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and revealed doctrine.
