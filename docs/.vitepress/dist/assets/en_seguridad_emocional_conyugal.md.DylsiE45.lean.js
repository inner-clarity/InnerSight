For this union to thrive, each spouse needs to feel <strong>safe to be authentic</strong>, without fear of being judged, corrected, or rejected for their internal needs.</p><p>When one spouse faces mental health challenges or neurological differences—such as trauma responses, autism, or Tourette syndrome—they may depend on certain strategies to maintain their emotional equilibrium. If these needs are <strong>misunderstood, minimized, or conditioned on acceptance</strong>, the emotional foundation of the marriage can be affected.</p><p>This document explains, from a clinical and doctrinal perspective, why <strong>mutual emotional security</strong> is essential for marital stability, and how compassionate support strengthens the bond between husband and wife.</p><h2 id="fundamental-principles" tabindex="-1">Fundamental Principles <a class="header-anchor" href="#fundamental-principles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fundamental Principles&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="security-as-the-foundation-of-connection" tabindex="-1">Security as the Foundation of Connection <a class="header-anchor" href="#security-as-the-foundation-of-connection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Security as the Foundation of Connection&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Contemporary neuroscience shows that people can only be fully present in a relationship when they feel <strong>safe at a physiological and emotional level</strong>. This security doesn&#39;t depend on external conformity, but on <strong>mutual validation</strong>.</p><p>When a spouse suppresses their regulatory needs to avoid conflict or gain approval, they may:</p><ul><li>Withdraw emotionally</li><li>Feel alone even in the other&#39;s presence</li><li>Lose confidence in their ability to be loved as they are</li></ul><p>This doesn&#39;t reflect a lack of love, but a natural response to perceived insecurity.</p><h3 id="marriage-as-refuge-not-tribunal" tabindex="-1">Marriage as Refuge, Not Tribunal <a class="header-anchor" href="#marriage-as-refuge-not-tribunal" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Marriage as Refuge, Not Tribunal&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Gospel doctrine teaches that the home should be a <strong>refuge from the world</strong>, not a place where tests of &quot;normality&quot; or &quot;spiritual strength&quot; are imposed. The Savior never conditioned His love on behavioral perfection.</p><p>As <em>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</em> teaches, marriage should be based on &quot;love, compassion, and mutual support.&quot; This includes making space for <strong>individual differences</strong>, especially when related to mental or neurological health.</p><h2 id="relevant-clinical-evidence" tabindex="-1">Relevant Clinical Evidence <a class="header-anchor" href="#relevant-clinical-evidence" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relevant Clinical Evidence&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="the-impact-of-chronic-invalidation" tabindex="-1">The Impact of Chronic Invalidation <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-impact-of-chronic-invalidation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Impact of Chronic Invalidation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Studies in relational psychology (Gottman &amp; Silver, 1999) identify <strong>lack of mutual validation</strong> as one of the main predictors of marital deterioration.

Authenticity doesn&#39;t mean absence of effort, but the freedom to be vulnerable without fear of rejection.</p><p>When both spouses feel safe to share their struggles—including emotional regulation needs—the relationship is strengthened, not weakened.</p><h2 id="support-based-on-gospel-principles" tabindex="-1">Support Based on Gospel Principles <a class="header-anchor" href="#support-based-on-gospel-principles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Support Based on Gospel Principles&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="unconditional-love-in-practice" tabindex="-1">Unconditional Love in Practice <a class="header-anchor" href="#unconditional-love-in-practice" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Unconditional Love in Practice&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The Apostle Paul taught that charity &quot;beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things&quot; (1 Corinthians 13:7). This doesn&#39;t mean tolerating harm, but <strong>seeking understanding before correction</strong>.</p><p>In the context of marriage, this translates to:</p><ul><li>Listening without judging</li><li>Asking before assuming</li><li>Supporting without demanding immediate change</li><li>Seeking professional help when useful</li></ul><h3 id="the-body-as-temple" tabindex="-1">The Body as Temple <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-body-as-temple" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Body as Temple&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The Scriptures teach that &quot;your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost&quot; (1 Corinthians 6:19). This includes respecting how each person experiences and regulates their emotions.
