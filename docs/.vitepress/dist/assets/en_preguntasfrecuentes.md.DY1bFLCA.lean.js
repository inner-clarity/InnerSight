Legitimate needs are verifiable by qualified professionals.</p><p><strong>Q: How do we differentiate between legitimate need and personal preference?</strong> A: [Specific DSM-5 criteria, neurological permanence, professional evaluation]</p><p><strong>Q: Does this contradict teachings about self-mastery?</strong> A: No. Self-mastery refers to conscious moral choices. Neurological adaptations are not &quot;lack of control&quot; but recognition of differences in how the brain functions.</p><p><strong>Q: What if a member claims to have a need but doesn&#39;t seek professional help?</strong> A: Gently encourage professional supervision, but don&#39;t condition support on this. Dignity doesn&#39;t require formal diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Q: Does this affect temple worthiness?</strong> A: Mental and neurological health conditions do not affect temple worthiness, which is based on testimony, obedience to commandments, and moral righteousness.</p><p><strong>Q: What if the member&#39;s family disagrees?</strong> A: [Guidance on family therapy, respect for both parties, not taking sides, focus on love and patience]</p><p><strong>Q: Do we have to allow EVERYTHING in Church activities?</strong> A: Reasonable accommodation is sought that allows dignified participation. Consult case by case with sensitivity and creativity.</p>',8)])])}const h=t(a,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,h as default};
