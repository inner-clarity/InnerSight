Legitimate needs are verifiable by qualified professionals.</p><p><strong>Q: How do we differentiate between legitimate need and personal preference?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> The difference is established through objective clinical criteria:</p><ol><li>Temporal consistency: The need is present for months or years, it&#39;s not a momentary preference</li><li>Resistance to voluntary change: It doesn&#39;t disappear with &quot;willpower&quot; or social pressure</li><li>Verifiable neurological basis: Associated with documented trauma, diagnosed neurological condition, or atypical neurological development pattern</li><li>Functionality maintenance: The person fulfills social, work and family roles effectively</li><li>Professional supervision: When possible, validated by specialists in trauma, neurology or psychiatry</li><li>Absence of harm to third parties: Doesn&#39;t cause physical or emotional harm to others</li></ol><p>According to DSM-5, pathology is defined by dysfunction, not by deviation from social norms. If a strategy allows effective functioning and well-being, it doesn&#39;t constitute a disorder regardless of its external appearance.</p><p><strong>Q: What if a member uses this as an &quot;excuse&quot; for inappropriate behavior?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> It&#39;s important to distinguish between legitimate needs and misuse of mental health concepts:</p><p><strong>Legitimate need:</strong></p><ul><li>Consistent and documentable pattern</li><li>Doesn&#39;t cause intentional harm to others</li><li>The person seeks or accepts professional help</li><li>Maintains basic responsibilities</li></ul><p><strong>Misuse of the concept:</strong></p><ul><li>Inconsistent or convenient justification</li><li>Deliberate harm to others</li><li>Total rejection of any support or limit</li><li>Severe functional deterioration without seeking help</li></ul><p>If there&#39;s genuine doubt, the leader should consult with LDS Family Services professionals, always maintaining respect for the individual&#39;s dignity.</p><h3 id="about-doctrine-and-worthiness" tabindex="-1">About Doctrine and Worthiness <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-doctrine-and-worthiness" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About Doctrine and Worthiness&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Q: Does this contradict teachings about self-mastery?</strong><strong>A:</strong> No. Self-mastery refers to conscious moral choices. Neurological adaptations are not &quot;lack of control&quot; but recognition of differences in how the brain functions.</p><p><strong>Q: Does this affect temple worthiness?</strong><strong>A:</strong> Mental and neurological health conditions don&#39;t affect temple worthiness, which is based on testimony, obedience to commandments, and moral righteousness.</p><h3 id="about-family-and-community" tabindex="-1">About Family and Community <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-family-and-community" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About Family and Community&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Q: What if the member&#39;s family doesn&#39;t agree?</strong><strong>A:</strong> This is one of the most difficult scenarios. Leaders should:</p><ol><li><strong>Not take sides</strong>: The leader&#39;s role is not to resolve family conflicts, but to minister to all with love</li><li><strong>Validate both experiences</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>For the member: &quot;I understand this is a real need for you&quot;</li><li>For the family: &quot;I understand this is difficult to comprehend&quot;</li></ul><ol start="3"><li><strong>Recommend professional help</strong>: Suggest family therapy with mental health specialists</li><li><strong>Remember doctrinal principles</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>&quot;By persuasion, by long-suffering&quot; (D&amp;C 121:41)</li><li>No pressure or ultimatum reflects Christ&#39;s love</li></ul><p><strong>Q: How do we balance individual support with congregation comfort?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Christ&#39;s Church must be refuge for all. Guiding principles:</p><ol><li>Priority: Inclusion of vulnerable members takes precedence over &quot;comfort&quot; based on ignorance</li><li>Education: When there&#39;s discomfort, the response is to gently educate the congregation about neurological diversity</li><li>Reasonable accommodations: Similar to how we adapt for physical disabilities (ramps, interpreters), we adapt for neurological needs</li><li>Privacy: Most regulatory needs don&#39;t require public explanation; simply respect for privacy</li><li>Doctrinal reminder: &quot;Judge not according to the appearance&quot; (John 7:24)</li></ol><p>If &quot;discomfort&quot; persisted after education, the problem is with those who judge, not with those who have the need.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Protect the vulnerable member</strong>: If there are threats of abandonment, coercion or emotional violence, the leader must intervene pastorally</li><li><strong>Long-term patience</strong>: Family understanding can take time; the process shouldn&#39;t be rushed</li></ol><p><strong>Key principle</strong>: The member&#39;s dignity before God doesn&#39;t depend on family consensus. Unity is sought through mutual understanding, not through forced conformity.</p><h3 id="about-practical-implementation" tabindex="-1">About Practical Implementation <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-practical-implementation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About Practical Implementation&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Q: Do we have to allow EVERYTHING in Church activities?</strong><strong>A:</strong> Reasonable accommodation is sought that allows dignified participation. Consult case by case with sensitivity and creativity.</p><p><strong>Q: What if a member claims to have a need but doesn&#39;t seek professional help?</strong><strong>A:</strong> Gently encourage professional supervision, but don&#39;t condition support on this. Dignity doesn&#39;t require formal diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Q: Does this also apply to children and youth?</strong></p><p><strong>A: Yes, especially to children and youth</strong>, for several reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Neurological development:</strong> Many regulatory needs emerge in childhood (autism, Tourette, trauma responses)</li><li><strong>Increased vulnerability:</strong> Youth are more susceptible to stigma and exclusion</li><li><strong>Importance of early intervention:</strong> Early support prevents additional psychological harm</li><li><strong>Parental involvement:</strong> Leaders should work with families, respecting that parents know their children best</li><li><strong>Adaptations in classes and activities:</strong> Allow children with special needs to participate fully</li></ol><p><strong>Special note:</strong> Never use terms like &quot;disorder&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot; in front of children. The language is: &quot;Your brain works in a unique way, and that&#39;s okay.&quot;</p>',36)])])}const m=t(a,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
