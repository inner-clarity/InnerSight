This question arises naturally when clinical information is lacking, but science and doctrine offer clarity.</p><p>Emotional regulation and sexual orientation belong to <strong>distinct domains</strong>: one is <strong>intrapersonal and regulatory</strong>, the other is <strong>interpersonal and relational</strong>. Understanding this difference helps avoid misunderstandings that can affect faith, belonging, and well-being of faithful members.</p><h2 id="what-is-emotional-regulation" tabindex="-1">What is emotional regulation? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-emotional-regulation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is emotional regulation?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Emotional regulation refers to the ways a person manages intense emotions or overwhelming sensations. It may include:</p><ul><li>Repetitive movements (such as rocking or hand rubbing)</li><li>Use of comfort objects or specific clothing</li><li>Rhythms, sounds, or symbolic behaviors</li></ul><p>Its purpose is to <strong>restore internal calm</strong>, not to express attraction to others. These strategies are common in people who have experienced trauma, have neurological differences (such as autism or Tourette&#39;s), or face sensory overload.</p><h2 id="what-is-sexual-orientation" tabindex="-1">What is sexual orientation? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-sexual-orientation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is sexual orientation?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Sexual orientation refers to the <strong>pattern of emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction</strong> toward people of a specific gender. It involves:</p><ul><li>Interpersonal desire</li><li>Affective bonds</li><li>Intention to connect with others</li></ul><p>It&#39;s not about isolated behaviors, but a persistent relational dimension.</p><h2 id="key-difference" tabindex="-1">Key difference <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-difference" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key difference&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p><strong>Emotional regulation seeks internal safety; sexual orientation seeks connection with others.</strong></p></blockquote><p>A regulatory behavior <strong>does not imply attraction, desire, or sexual arousal</strong>, even if its external form seems unusual.

Studies confirm they <strong>are not associated with sexual attraction</strong>, but with sensory needs (Kapp et al., 2019).</li><li><strong>PTSD</strong>: Some people use objects or rituals that remind them of childhood to feel safe. This <strong>is not sexual regression</strong>, but seeking emotional containment (Van der Kolk, 2014).</li><li><strong>Tourette Syndrome</strong>: Some tics may include unusual words or gestures, but <strong>do not reflect the person&#39;s desires</strong>.

This invites us not to assume motives based on what we see externally.</p><p>Additionally, <em>&quot;The Lord looketh on the heart&quot;</em> (1 Samuel 16:7).
