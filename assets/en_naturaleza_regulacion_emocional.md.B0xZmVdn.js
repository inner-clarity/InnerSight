This question arises naturally when clinical information is lacking, but science and doctrine offer clarity.</p><p><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/ClearPath/en/prenc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emotional regulation</a> and sexual orientation belong to <strong>distinct domains</strong>: one is <strong>intrapersonal and regulatory</strong>, the other is <strong>interpersonal and relational</strong>.

It may include:</p><ul><li>Repetitive movements (such as rocking or hand rubbing)</li><li>Use of comfort objects or specific clothing</li><li>Rhythms, sounds, or symbolic behaviors</li></ul><p>Its purpose is to <strong>restore internal calm</strong>, not to express attraction to others. These strategies are common in people who have experienced trauma, have neurological differences (such as <a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/ClearPath/en/autismo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">autism</a> or <a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/ClearPath/en/tourette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tourette&#39;s</a>), or face sensory overload.</p><h2 id="what-is-sexual-orientation" tabindex="-1">What is sexual orientation? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-sexual-orientation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is sexual orientation?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Sexual orientation refers to the <strong>pattern of emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction</strong> toward people of a specific gender.

This invites us not to assume motives based on what we see externally.</p><p>Additionally, <em>&quot;The Lord looketh on the heart&quot;</em> (1 Samuel 16:7).
